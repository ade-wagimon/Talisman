# Talisman


Creating a magic talisman involves arranging the Enochian script in a visually compelling and symbolic way. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a talisman for luck and wealth:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Central Symbol:** Start with a central symbol, such as a circle or star, representing unity and completeness.
2. **Enochian Phrase:** Write the Enochian phrase around the central symbol.
3. **Decorative Elements:** Add additional symbols or geometric shapes to enhance the talisman's visual appeal and mystical significance.

### Talisman Design

Here is a textual description of the design for the talisman. You can sketch it based on these instructions or use graphic design software:

1. **Central Symbol:** Draw a large circle in the center.
2. **Enochian Phrase:** Write the Enochian phrase in a circular fashion around the central circle.
3. **Decorative Elements:** Add smaller circles or stars at the cardinal points around the phrase to symbolize the spread of luck and wealth in all directions.

Here's a simple textual representation of how it can be arranged:

            𐤁𐤉𐤀𐤉              𐤋𐤁𐤉𐤀
  𐤀𐤏𐤅𐤁𐤀                          𐤃𐤀𐤒𐤀
𐤃𐤀𐤒𐤀                              𐤃𐤓𐤏
  𐤁𐤋𐤏𐤐                          𐤀𐤋𐤄𐤐
            𐤌𐤂𐤎              𐤋𐤅𐤇𐤀𐤉𐤌
                       𐤀𐤌𐤂𐤎
```

plt.show()


### Using the Talisman

- **Material:** Draw or engrave the talisman on a piece of paper, parchment, or a metal disc.
- **Activation:** Charge the talisman with your intent through meditation, prayer, or ritual.
- **Placement:** Carry it with you or place it in a location associated with your financial activities, such as your wallet, office, or home.

Creating and using a talisman is a deeply personal and symbolic act, so feel free to adapt the design and process to fit your beliefs and practices.


Creating an authentic Enochian spell requires using the Enochian alphabet and syntax, as devised by John Dee and Edward Kelley. Here is a phrase invoking luck and wealth translated into Enochian.


### Enochian Spell for Luck and Wealth

**Enochian Script:**
**𐤀𐤌𐤂𐤎 𐤀𐤋𐤄𐤐 𐤃𐤓𐤏 𐤁𐤋𐤏𐤐 𐤃𐤀𐤒𐤀 𐤁𐤉𐤀𐤉 𐤀𐤏𐤅𐤁𐤀 𐤄𐤐𐤂𐤇 𐤋𐤁𐤉𐤀 𐤃𐤀𐤒𐤀 𐤋𐤅𐤇𐤀𐤉𐤌**

**Transliteration:**
**"Amgs Aleph Dri Blaph Daqa Biai Auba Hepgh Lbia Daqa Luhaiym"**

**Translation:**
**"By the divine blessing, may you receive luck and wealth."**

This Enochian phrase invokes divine favor for luck and wealth. As Enochian is a constructed language with its roots in mystical and angelic traditions, the phrase should be treated with respect and used in a context appropriate to its origin.

Creating a real Enochian talisman according to the original manuscripts by John Dee and Edward Kelley requires a careful reproduction of their designs and symbols. One of the most well-known Enochian talismans is the **Sigillum Dei Aemeth**. Below, I will describe how you can create this talisman based on historical references.

### Sigillum Dei Aemeth

**Description:**
- **Central Design:** A heptagram (seven-pointed star) surrounded by a heptagon, and inscribed within a larger circle.
- **Names and Symbols:** Angelic names and other mystical symbols are written within and around the geometric shapes.

### Steps to Create the Sigillum Dei Aemeth

1. **Draw the Outer Circle:**
   - Start by drawing a large circle on your medium (paper, parchment, etc.).

2. **Draw the Heptagram and Heptagon:**
   - Inside the large circle, draw a heptagram. Connect the inner points of the heptagram with a heptagon.

3. **Add Angelic Names and Symbols:**
   - Write the following names of the angels in Enochian characters in the spaces between the points of the heptagram and around the heptagon:

#### Angelic Names:
- **Gabriel:** 𐤀𐤁𐤓𐤇𐤋
- **Michael:** 𐤋𐤊𐤉𐤀𐤋
- **Raphael:** 𐤀𐤉𐤏𐤔𐤋
- **Uriel:** 𐤀𐤅𐤓𐤉𐤋
- **Salathiel:** 𐤓𐤉𐤀𐤊𐤋𐤇
- **Anael:** 𐤀𐤊𐤋
- **Zadkiel:** 𐤎𐤀𐤕𐤋𐤇

4. **Additional Symbols:**
   - Add other mystical symbols and Enochian letters around the outer circle and within the geometric shapes to enhance the talisman's appearance and efficacy.

### Example Layout

Here is an example of the layout for the Sigillum Dei Aemeth:

```
                𐤀𐤉𐤏𐤔𐤋 (Raphael)
        𐤓𐤉𐤀𐤊𐤋𐤇 (Salathiel)     𐤀𐤅𐤓𐤉𐤋 (Uriel)
   𐤋𐤊𐤉𐤀𐤋 (Michael)   *   𐤀𐤁𐤓𐤇𐤋 (Gabriel)
        𐤀𐤊𐤋 (Anael)        𐤎𐤀𐤕𐤋𐤇 (Zadkiel)
                𐤀𐤊𐤋 (Anael)
```

### Creating the Talisman

1. **Material:** Draw or engrave the talisman on a piece of paper, parchment, or a metal disc.
2. **Activation:** Charge the talisman with your intent through meditation, prayer, or ritual. You can recite invocations or prayers to the angels whose names are on the talisman.
3. **Placement:** Keep the talisman in a place where you seek protection and divine guidance, such as your home, altar, or carry it with you.
